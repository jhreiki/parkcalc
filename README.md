Project goals: reproduce Parking Calculator example from ATDD by Example, by Markus Gaertner
I am using the parking calcultor example from Markus Gaertner's ATDD by example as a continuing education exercise.
My strategy is to build all source needed to implement the example including:
- Web application source needed for the parking calculator application
- cucumber files for the cucumber test scenarios
